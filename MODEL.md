# Model — M2M Billing Semantics

This document defines the **conceptual reference model** for M2M Billing.

The model describes how machine-generated actions become **measurable usage**
and how such usage qualifies for **settlement**, independent of monetary execution.

---

## Model Overview

The M2M Billing reference model consists of **four sequential layers**:

1. Event
2. Meter
3. Attribution
4. Settlement

Each layer is **necessary but not sufficient** on its own.
The layers are complementary and must be evaluated in order.

---

## Layer 1 — Event

An **Event** represents a discrete, machine-generated action or state change.

### Characteristics
- Generated by an autonomous or semi-autonomous system
- Timestamped and uniquely identifiable
- Contextualized (actor, target, environment)

### Examples (non-exhaustive)
- API call execution
- Task initiation or completion
- Resource activation (compute, mobility, access)
- State transition with operational impact

Events alone are **not billable**.  
They form the raw input for measurement.

---

## Layer 2 — Meter

A **Meter** aggregates or qualifies events into **measurable usage units**.

### Characteristics
- Applies counting, aggregation, or normalization rules
- Defines units of measure (time, volume, executions, distance, etc.)
- Resolves noise, retries, and non-qualifying events

### Purpose
The meter establishes **quantifiable usage** from raw events.

Meters do not assign responsibility or value.
They only answer: *“What happened, and how much?”*

---

## Layer 3 — Attribution

**Attribution** links measured usage to an **accountable entity**.

### Characteristics
- Resolves which system, agent, or organizational identity is responsible
- Supports one-to-one and one-to-many relationships
- Handles delegation, orchestration, and proxy execution scenarios

### Purpose
Attribution answers: *“Who is accountable for this usage?”*

Without attribution, usage cannot be settled.

---

## Layer 4 — Settlement

**Settlement** determines whether attributed usage **qualifies for billing**.

### Characteristics
- Applies deterministic qualification rules
- Evaluates thresholds, contractual boundaries, or policy conditions
- Resolves disputes via predefined logic, not interpretation

### Important Distinction
Settlement is **logical**, not financial.

It concludes:
> “This usage qualifies for billing.”

It does **not** execute payment, pricing, or invoicing.

---

## Layer Independence

- Layers must be evaluated **in sequence**
- Outputs of one layer become inputs to the next
- No layer substitutes another

Skipping layers results in **ambiguous or non-reproducible outcomes**.

---

## Model Discipline

This model:
- does not prescribe architectures
- does not endorse standards or protocols
- does not define commercial terms

The model exists to provide **shared semantic structure**
for interoperable and auditable M2M billing systems.

Changes to the model must be versioned explicitly.
