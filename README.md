# M2M Billing — Reference

This repository provides a **versioned reference specification**
for **machine-to-machine (M2M) billing semantics**.

In this context, *billing* refers to the **technical determination**
that measurable, attributed machine usage qualifies for **settlement**.
It does not refer to pricing, payments, or commercial execution.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to define **shared semantic boundaries**
for usage qualification between autonomous systems.

It supports:
- reproducible interpretation,
- auditability across system boundaries,
- and interoperability of independent implementations.

## What This Repository Is

- A **reference layer** for attribution, metering, and settlement semantics
- A **non-commercial**, non-vendor specification
- A **machine-readable** and versioned documentation set

- provide payment or billing services,
- define pricing or tariffs,
- recommend architectures or tools,
- certify systems or implementations,
- offer regulatory or legal guidance.
